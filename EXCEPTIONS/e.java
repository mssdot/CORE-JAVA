/*
 * In the code you provided, the ArithmeticException will be thrown at runtime when the program tries to divide an integer by zero. Since there is no try-catch block in the code to catch this exception, the exception will propagate up the call stack until it is caught by an appropriate try-catch block or until it reaches the top level of the program, at which point the program will terminate and print a stack trace to the console.

In the case of your code, the ArithmeticException will be thrown in methodb() and will propagate up to main() because methodb() does not have a try-catch block to catch the exception. Since main() also does not have a try-catch block to catch the exception, the exception will propagate up to the top level of the program, at which point the program will terminate and print a stack trace to the console.

So, while the exception is not explicitly handled within the code, it is still being handled by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) internally through the process of propagating the exception up the call stack until it is caught by an appropriate try-catch block or until it reaches the top level of the program.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * In the context of your code, the top level of the program refers to the main() method. This is the entry point of the program, and any uncaught exceptions that propagate up the call stack will eventually reach the main() method. If the exception is not caught by a try-catch block in the main() method, the program will terminate and a stack trace will be printed to the console.

So in this case, if the ArithmeticException is not caught by a try-catch block in methodb(), it will propagate up to the main() method, which does not have a try-catch block to catch the exception. Therefore, the program will terminate and a stack trace will be printed to the console.

 * In the code you provided earlier, you didn't put the methodb() call in a try block in the main method. Therefore, if methodb() throws an exception, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top level of the program, at which point the program will terminate. Here's the updated code to demonstrate this:
